# Little Rogue

Little Rogue is a roguelike game made with python and pygame library, 

It features basic roguelike gameplay, such as, exploration of random generated dungeon, fighting monsters, gaining experience, and picking up items on the ground.

The game was made by following this tutorial on roguebasin on how to make roguelike games using python:
http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Complete_Roguelike_Tutorial,_using_python%2Blibtcod
the tutorial uses the libtcod library, but it was ported to pygame.

My work starts after the game was developed with said resources, as I proceeded to write the AI behaviors for the main character with the objective of reaching the highest levels possible.

Simply open the Little_Rogue.py file on your Python IDE of choice and run it.

It will open two windows: one showcasing the pathing algorithm at work and the other showing the game in motion with the AI progressing through it.
